# Crowdfunding-ETL
## Overview
The purpose of this project was to clean up "dirty" data sets from Independent Funding, in order to make more comprehensible tables to later perform analysis on.  The clean data was then used to create an ERD diagram in order to show relationships between the sets.  Then, these sets were used to create a database and table queries in PostgreSQL.  After the database was created, the data sets were loaded into the tables and analysis was done.  

## Results
After performing analysis in the data sets, I was able to first create an additional table showing each contact and their remaining goal amount as shown below:

I was also able to create a table that showed each backer, and the amount remainign on each campaign they have pledged:
