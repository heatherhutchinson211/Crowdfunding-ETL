# Crowdfunding-ETL
## Overview
The objective of this project was to refine and enhance "unclean" data sets sourced from Independent Funding. The primary goal was to transform these datasets into coherent and intelligible tables, laying the groundwork for subsequent in-depth analyses. The refined data was then leveraged to construct an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD), elucidating the intricate interrelationships among the datasets. This conceptual foundation was further utilized to establish a robust PostgreSQL database, complete with meticulously crafted table queries. Following the successful creation of the database, the meticulously refined data sets were seamlessly integrated into their respective tables, paving the way for a comprehensive analytical exploration.
## Results
After performing analysis in the data sets, I was able to first create an additional table showing each contact and their remaining goal amount as shown below:

I was also able to create a table that showed each backer, and the amount remaining on each campaign they have pledged:
